## Event transformation

RudderStack ingests the Olark events after converting them into the RudderStack event format. It also maps the following properties from the Olark event payload to the RudderStack properties:

| Olark property  | RudderStack property|
| :------------------ | :------------- |
| `email`  | `email`    | 
| `triggered_event`        | `event`        | 
|  `attributes.user_id` | `userId`        | 
| `attributes` <br/> `segments` | `context.traits`        | 
| `account`     | `traits`   | 
| `response` <br/>`form`    | `properties`  | 
| `last_form_submission_at`     | `originaltimestamp`   |
