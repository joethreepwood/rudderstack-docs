With RudderStack Cloud Extract, you can collect your raw events and data from different cloud tools such as [**Facebook Ads**](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads), [**Google Analytics**](https://analytics.google.com/), [**Marketo**](https://www.marketo.com/), [**HubSpot**](https://www.hubspot.com/), [**Stripe**](stripe/), and more. You can then build efficient ELT pipelines from these cloud apps to your data warehouse.

<div class="warningBlock">
All the Cloud Extract sources support sending data only to a <Link to="/destinations/warehouse-destinations/">data warehouse destination</Link>.
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">
It is recommended to connect <strong>only one</strong> warehouse destination to a Cloud Extract source. To send data to multiple data warehouses from the same source, we recommend creating individual sources with the same settings for each warehouse destination.
