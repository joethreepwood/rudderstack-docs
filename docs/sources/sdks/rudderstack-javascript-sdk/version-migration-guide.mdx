description: Step-by-step guide on migrating the RudderStack JavaScript SDK from v1 to v1.1.
---

The latest version of **JavaScript SDK (v1.1)** is lightweight, efficient, and optimized as compared to v1:

|Features|v1.1|v1|
|---------|--|----|
|Size|34 KB<sup>*</sup>|114 KB<sup>*</sup>|
|<Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">Device mode</Link> destinations| Published as individual plugins and loaded dynamically as per the specified dashboard configurations.| Bundled with the core SDK.|

<div class="infoBlock">
The SDK size may vary in future with more functionalities being added.
</div>

The below section covers the steps to migrate to JavaScript SDK v1.1 depending on your JavaScript SDK v1 installation.

## Case 1: Loading the SDK from RudderStack CDN

Update the script tag in your website as shown:

From **v1**:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1/rudder-analytics.min.js" />
```

To **v1.1**:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js" />
```

## Case 2: Forwarding/proxying the RudderStack CDN

Follow these steps:

1. Log into your CDN provider account.
2. Go to the distribution and set the origin to RudderStack's CDN. Ensure that the entire domain (`https://cdn.rudderlabs.com`) is set as the origin.

<div class="infoBlock">
It is highly recommended to forward the entire CDN path <code class="inline-code">https://cdn.rudderlabs.com</code> so that you don't miss any files/directories that might be added in the future.
</div>

<div class="successBlock">
Refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/custom-domains/">custom domains</a> guide for more information on CDN forwarding/proxying.
</div>

3.  Go to **Behaviors** and verify that the sub-path `/v1.1/*` is **not configured to be blocked** in any way. This is required to ensure that both the core SDK and destination SDKs are forwarded properly.

4. Finally, update the script tag in your website as shown:

From **v1**:

```html
<script src="https://<subdomain>.<yourdomain>.com/v1/rudder-analytics.min.js" />
```

To **v1.1**:

```html
<script src="https://<subdomain>.<yourdomain>.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js" />
```

## Case 3: Self-hosting RudderStack's CDN

If you have cloned RudderStack's JavaScript SDK and are self-hosting it via your own CDN, follow the steps below:

1. Download the core [JavaScript SDK v1.1](https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js).
2. Download all the destination SDKs listed [here](#loading-from-rudderstack-cdn).
3. Move all the downloaded files to your preferred location.

It is recommended to maintain the following structure:

<img src="../../../assets/js-sdk-version-migration.png" alt="Recommended structure for self-hosting RudderStack's CDN" />

4. Next, check the core SDK's file name:
- If it is **not** `rudder-analytics.min.js`, update the script tag in your website, as shown:

```html
<script>
// rudderanalytics object initialization
// ...
// ...
// provide the location of the destination SDKs in the load options
rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>, {
    destSDKBaseURL: "https://cdn.<yourdomain>.com/js-integrations"
});
// ...
// ...
</script>

<script src="https://cdn.<yourdomain>.com/<your-custom-analytics-file>.js"></script>
```

- If it **is** `rudder-analytics.min.js` and:
  - The destination SDKs are located next to the core SDK file under the `js-integrations` directory, update the script tag as shown:

    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.<yourdomain>.com/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>
    ```

  - The destination SDKs are **not** located next to the core SDK file under the `js-integrations` directory, update the script tag as shown:

      ```html
      <script>
      // rudderanalytics object initialization
      // ...
      // ...
      // provide the location of the destination SDKs in the load options
      rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>, {
          destSDKBaseURL: "https://cdn.<yourdomain>.com/custom-js-integrations"
      });
      // ...
      // ...
      </script>

      <script src="https://cdn.<yourdomain>.com/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>
      ```

## Case 4: Migrating version using NPM

The latest NPM package is based on JavaScript SDK v1.1 architecture and is released with the 2.x.x version. To update the SDK package using NPM, use any of the following options:

* Upgrade `rudder-sdk-js` package to the latest version using the below command:

```javascript
npm install rudder-sdk-js@latest
```

* Upgrade `rudder-sdk-js` package to a specific version using the below command:

```javascript
npm install rudder-sdk-js@2.x.x
```

* Manually modify the **package.json** file like below and run `npm install`:

```javascript
"dependencies": {
  "rudder-sdk-js": "^2.x.x"
}
```
## Loading device mode destinations

The device mode destinations are not bundled in the core JavaScript SDK v1.1 by default and needs to be loaded using any of the below-mentioned ways: 

### Forwarding/proxying the RudderStack CDN

If you are forwarding or proxying RudderStack's CDN, follow the steps 1, 2 and 3 from <Link to="#case-2-forwardingproxying-the-rudderstack-cdn">here</Link> and finally use the `destSDKBaseURL` option in the SDK's `load()` call, as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load( <WRITE_KEY> , <DATA_PLANE_URL> , {
  destSDKBaseURL: "<custom-path-for-device-mode-destination>", // ex: "https://cdn.<yourdomain>.com/js-integrations"
  ...otherOptions
});
```

### Self-hosting RudderStack's device mode SDKs

If you have cloned RudderStack's JavaScript SDK and are self-hosting it, follow the steps 2 and 3 from <Link to="#case-3-self-hosting-rudderstacks-cdn">here</Link> and finally use the `destSDKBaseURL` option in the SDK's `load()` call, as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load( <WRITE_KEY> , <DATA_PLANE_URL> , {
  destSDKBaseURL: "<custom-path-for-device-mode-destination>", // ex: "https://cdn.<yourdomain>.com/js-integrations"
  ...otherOptions
});
```

### Loading from RudderStack CDN

You can load the device mode destinations from https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/js-integrations/ path. The individual paths for each destination are listed in the table below:

<div class="warningBlock">
The destination SDK names should not be changed as the custom names are not supported by RudderStack.

## FAQ

### How are the destination SDKs loaded in v1.1?

The core JavaScript SDK v1.1 does not contain any destination-specific SDKs by default. Depending on the device mode destinations configured in your dashboard (control plane), the required SDKs are dynamically fetched from the hosted location.

The hosted location can be either of the following:

* RudderStack CDN
* Your CDN that proxies the RudderStack CDN
* Self-hosted domain

### How does RudderStack determine the destination SDKs' root location?

RudderStack follows the below precedence order while determining the root location of the destination SDKs:

1. Refers the `destSDKBaseURL` value in the `options` parameter of the `load` API call.
2. If absent, checks the `src` attribute of the `<script>` tag that adds the core JavaScript SDK to your website. `/js-integrations` is automatically appended to the root location.
3. If none of the above options are applicable, uses the default CDN URL `https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/js-integrations/`.
