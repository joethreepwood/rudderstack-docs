title: "Filtering"
description: Detailed guide on different types of filtering operations supported by the JavaScript SDK.
---
This guide covers how to achieve the following filtering operations:
* Filtering events while sending them to the specified destinations.
* Filtering destinations where the event data should be sent.

## Filtering events

When sending events to a destination via the **web device mode**, you can explicitly specify which events should be discarded or allowed to flow through - by allowlisting or denylisting them using the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/event-filtering/">Client-side Event Filtering</a> feature.

## Filtering destinations

You can send the event data only to the selective destinations by passing an <Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#integrationopts">integrations</Link>  object in the **loadOptions** parameter. RudderStack then loads or sends events only to the specified and enabled destinations.

* A sample snippet to send event data only to the **Google Analytics** and **Intercom** destinations:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>, {
  integrations: {
    All: false,
    "Google Analytics": true,
    Intercom: true
  }
});
```

* A sample `track` method to send event data only to the **Google Analytics** destination:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "Order Completed",
  {
    revenue: 30,
    currency: "USD",
    user_actual_id: 12345
  },
  {
    integrations: {
      All: false,
      "Google Analytics": true
    }
  }
);
```
The destinaton name inside the `integrations` object should be in the specified format, such as:

* Google Analytics: `Google Analytics`/`GoogleAnalytics`/`GA`
* Kochava:     `Kochava`    
* Amplitude: `Amplitude`/`AMPLITUDE`
