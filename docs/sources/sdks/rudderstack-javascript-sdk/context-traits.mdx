  Detailed guide on capturing the event-specific and user-specific data using the context and trait dictionaries.
---

RudderStack provides the option to automatically capture the certain event-specific and user-specific data, based on the type of the event.

The `context` and `traits` dictionaries are provided in the <Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#api_options">`api_options`</Link> parameter of the supported API methods.

## Context

The `context` is a dictionary of additional information about a particular event data, such as a userâ€™s locale.

<div class="infoBlock">
A context is a complete and specific piece of information. Any other information provided outside this specification is ignored.
</div>

## Traits

The `traits` is an optional dictionary included within <Link to="#context">`context`</Link> which specifies the user's unique traits. This is a very useful field for linking the user's information from a previously made <Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#identify">`identify`</Link> call to the subsequent <Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#track">`track`</Link> or <Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#page">`page`</Link> calls.

### Use-case

To understand the concept of context and traits better, refer to the following `identify` event:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm", {
  plan: "Paid, Premium",
  email: "alex@example.com"
});
```

The `plan` and `email` are traits in the above event. If you wish to include this trait in a subsequent `track` or `page` event triggered by the user, you can establish the association by passing it in `context.traits` as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "Subscribed",
  {
    campaign: "Subscribe"
  },
  {
    context: {
      traits: {
        plan: "Paid, Premium"
      }
    }
  }
);
```

The above snippet will append `plan` as a trait to the `track` event. Note that the `email` trait will not be appended, as it is not specified in the `context.traits` field.
