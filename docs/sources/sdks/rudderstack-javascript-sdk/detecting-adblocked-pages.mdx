description: Detailed guide on detecting the ad-blocked pages uisng the JavaScript SDK.
---

The JavaScript SDK lets you send a page view containing the relevant markers that determine whether a page is ad-blocked. You can analyze this data to find what percentage of your website's page views are affected by the ad blockers.

## Sending an ad-blocked page view

To send an ad-blocked page view, load the JavaScript SDK as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {
  sendAdblockPage: true,
  sendAdblockPageOptions: {
    integrations: {
      All: false,
      Amplitude: true
    }
  }
});
```

<div class="infoBlock">
Replace the <Link to="/resources/glossary/#write-key">Write key</Link> and <Link to="/dashboard-guides/overview/#data-plane-url">data plane URL</Link> in the above snippet with actual values.
</div>

The properties included in the above snippet are explained as below:

* **`sendAdblockPage`**: It enables the JavaScript SDK to make a call to load the [**Google AdSense**](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/) library. If RudderStack fails to load this library, it concludes that an ad blocker is enabled on the page.

<div class="infoBlock">
Since most ad blockers block the request to the Google AdSense servers, this approach is assumed as a good measure to detect ad-blocked pages.
</div>

* **`sendAdblockPageOptions`**: If the `sendAdblockPage` property is set to `true`, the JavaScript SDK will make an implicit `page` call about the ad-blocked pages.

With `sendAdblockPageOptions` (internally contains the [`IntegrationOpts`](https://docs.rudderstack.com/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk#integrationopts) object), you can provide the destinations to which you want to forward this `page` call.

<div class="infoBlock">
Refer to the <a href="https://docs.rudderstack.com/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/#filtering-selective-destinations">Filtering selective destinations</a> guide for more information on filtering the destinations.
</div>

The implicit `page` call semantics is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page(
  "RudderJS-Initiated",
  "ad-block page request",
  {
    path: "/ad-blocked",
    title:
      "error in script loading:: src::  http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js id:: ad-block"
  },
  sendAdblockPageOptions
);
```
