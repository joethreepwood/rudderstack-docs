    - <Link to="/sources/event-streams/cloud-apps/">Cloud Apps</Link>: Ingest event data from your cloud apps and route it to the desired destinations.
    - <Link to="/sources/extract/">Cloud Extract</Link>: Build ELT pipelines from cloud apps to your data warehouse.
    - <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/">Reverse ETL</Link>: Leverage your warehouse as a data source for your entire customer data stack.

5. Once you have configured the data source, you will see the following source details page.
