RudderStack gives you the option to automatically capture certain event-specific and user-specific data, based on the type of the event.

In this section, we cover two specific dictionaries within the [`options`](#options) parameter included in the supported API methods.

### Context

A context is a dictionary of additional information about a particular event data, such as a user’s locale.

<div class="infoBlock">

A context is a complete and specific piece of information. Any other information provided outside of this specification is ignored.
</div>

### Traits

Traits is an optional dictionary included within [`context`](#context) which specifies the user's unique traits. This is a very useful field for linking the user's information from a previously made [`identify()`](#identify) call to the subsequent [`track()`](#track) or [`page()`](#page) calls.

#### Use-case

To better understand how contexts and traits work, refer to the following `identify` event:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("userId", {
  plan: "Paid, Premium",
  email: "name@surname.org"
});
```

The trait in the above event is `plan`. If you wish to include this trait in a subsequent `track()` or `page()`event triggered by the user, you can establish the association by passing it in `context.traits` as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "Subscribed",
  {
    campaign: "Subscribe"
  },
  {
    context: {
      traits: {
        plan: "Paid, Premium"
      }
    }
  }
);
```

The above snippet will append `plan` as a trait to the `track` event. Note that the trait `email` will not be appended, as it was not specified in the `context.traits` field.
