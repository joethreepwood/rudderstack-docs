## Filtering events

When sending events to a destination via the **web device mode**, you can explicitly specify which events should be discarded or allowed to flow through - by allowlisting or denylisting them.

## Filtering selective destinations

RudderStack lets you load or send your event data to only the destinations specified by you. You can do so by passing an [**integrations object**](#integrationopts) in the `options` parameter of the API methods. RudderStack then loads or sends events only to those destinations that are specified and enabled.

The format of the `load` method with the integration names passed as arguments is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {
  integrations: {
    All: false,
    destination_name: true
  }
});
```
Here, `<destination_name>` is the name of the destination.

### Examples

* The format of the `track` method with the integration names passed as arguments is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "test track event GA3",
  {
    revenue: 30,
    currency: "USD",
    user_actual_id: 12345
  },
  {
    integrations: {
      All: false,
      destination_name: true
    }
  }
);
```

* The following example shows how to load only the Google Analytics and Intercom destinations:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {
  integrations: {
    All: false,
    "Google Analytics": true,
    Intercom: true
  }
});
```

* The following example highlights how you can send the `track` type of events only to Google Analytics:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "test track event GA3",
  {
    revenue: 30,
    currency: "USD",
    user_actual_id: 12345
  },
  {
    integrations: {
      All: false,
      "Google Analytics": true
    }
  }
);
```
