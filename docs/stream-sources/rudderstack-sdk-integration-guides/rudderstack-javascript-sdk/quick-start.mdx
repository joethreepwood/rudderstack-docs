You can try adding the browser polyfills to your application if the SDK does not work on the browser versions you are targeting.
</div>

## Step 1: Install JavaScript SDK

To integrate the SDK with your website and load it asynchronously, place the following code in the `<head>` section of your website.

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
!function(){var e=window.rudderanalytics=window.rudderanalytics||[];e.methods=["load","page","track","identify","alias","group","ready","reset","getAnonymousId","setAnonymousId"],e.factory=function(t){return function(){var r=Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);return r.unshift(t),e.push(r),e}};for(var t=0;t<e.methods.length;t++){var r=e.methods[t];e[r]=e.factory(r)}e.loadJS=function(e,t){var r=document.createElement("script");r.type="text/javascript",r.async=!0,r.src="https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js";var a=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];a.parentNode.insertBefore(r,a)},e.loadJS(),
e.load(<WRITE_KEY>,<DATA_PLANE_URL>),
e.page()}();
</script>
```

<div class="infoBlock">
Replace the <Link to="/get-started/glossary/#write-key">Write key</Link> and <Link to="/dashboard-guides/overview/#data-plane-url">data plane url</Link>.
</div>

The above code snippet:

- Creates an array to store the events until the analytics object is ready.
- Stores the following methods to replay them when the analytics object is ready:

| Method           | Description                                          |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| <Link to="/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#load">`load()`</Link>     | Loads `rudder-analytics.js` with your write key. |
| <Link to="/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/page">`page()`</Link>     | Records page views whenever a user visits a page.    |
| <Link to="/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track">`track()`</Link>   | Tracks user actions and important events.            |
| <Link to="/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/identify">`identify()`</Link> | Associates users and their traits or actions.        |
|`reset()`    | Resets the `userid` and the associated traits.       |

- Loads the analytics object with your write key.
- Makes the `page()`call to track the page view. It auto-captures properties such as `path`, `referrer`, `search`, `title`, and `URL`. If you want to override them, refer to the [**`page`**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/#page) API method.

### Minified code

```javascript
<script>
rudderanalytics=window.rudderanalytics=[];for(var methods=["load","page","track","identify","alias","group","ready","reset","getAnonymousId","setAnonymousId"],i=0;i<methods.length;i++){var method=methods[i];rudderanalytics[method]=function(a){return function(){rudderanalytics.push([a].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)))}}(method)}rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>,<DATA_PLANE_URL>),rudderanalytics.page();
</script>

<script src="https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>
```

### Non-minified code

```javascript
<script>
  rudderanalytics = window.rudderanalytics = [];
  var methods = [
    "load",
    "page",
    "track",
    "identify",
    "alias",
    "group",
    "ready",
    "reset",
    "getAnonymousId",
    "setAnonymousId",
  ];
  for (var i = 0; i < methods.length; i++) {
    var method = methods[i];
    rudderanalytics[method] = (function (methodName) {
      return function () {
        rudderanalytics.push(
          [methodName].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments))
        );
      };
    })(method);
  }

  rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>);
  rudderanalytics.page();
</script>

<script src="https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>
```

<div class="infoBlock">
In all the above versions, there is an explicit <code class="inline-code">page</code> call at the end. This is added to ensure that whenever the SDK loads in a page, a <code class="inline-code">page</code> call is sent. You can remove this call completely or modify it with the extra page properties to suit your requirement. You can also add <code class="inline-code">page</code> calls in your application in places not tied directly to page load, e.g., virtual page views, page renders on route change such as in SPAs.
</div>

### Alternative installation using NPM

While it is recommended to use the above-mentioned snippets to use the JavaScript SDK with your website, you can also use the [**NPM module**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rudder-sdk-js) to package RudderStack directly into your project.

To install the SDK via npm, run the following command:

```bash
npm install rudder-sdk-js --save
```

<div class="warningBlock">

This NPM module is only meant to be used for a browser installation. If you want to integrate RudderStack with a Node.js application, refer to the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-node">RudderStack Node.js repository</a>.
</div>

#### Using the exported object

Since the module exports the related APIs on an already-defined object combined with the Node.js module caching, you should run the following code snippet **only once** and use the exported object throughout your project:

```jsx
import * as rudderanalytics from "rudder-sdk-js";
rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>);
rudderanalytics.ready(() => {
  console.log("We are all set!!!");
});
export { rudderanalytics };
```

You can also do this with **ES5** using the `require` method, as shown in the following snippet:

```jsx
var rudderanalytics = require("rudder-sdk-js");
rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>);
exports.rudderanalytics = rudderanalytics;
```

The related APIs exported by the module are:

- `load`
- `ready`
- `identify`
- `alias`
- `page`
- `track`
- `group`
- `reset`
- `getAnonymousId`
- `setAnonymousId`

<div class="infoBlock">
Refer to the sample <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-analytics-angular">Angular</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-analytics-react">React</a> projects for a detailed walk-through of the above steps.
</div>

## Step 2: Identify users

The <Link to="/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/identify">`identify`</Link> method lets you identify a user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record any traits about them like their name, email, etc.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm",
  {
    email: "alex@example.com"
  },
  {
    page: {
      path: "/best-seller/1",
      referrer: "https://www.google.com/search?q=estore+bestseller",
      search: "estore bestseller",
      title: "The best sellers offered by EStore",
      url: "https://www.estore.com/best-seller/1"
    }
  },
  () => {
    console.log("identify call");
  }
);
```

In the above example, the user-related information like `userId` and `email` is captured along with the <Link to="/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/common-fields/#javascript-sdk">contextual information</Link>.

<div class="infoBlock">

  There is no need to call <code class="inline-code">identify()</code> for anonymous visitors to your website. Such visitors are automatically assigned an <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code>.
</div>

<div class="successBlock">

  For more information, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/#identify">Identify</a> section of the SDK documentation.
</div>

## Step 3: Track users' actions

The <Link to="/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track"><code class="inline-code">track</code></Link> method lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "Order Completed", {
    revenue: 77.6,
    currency: "USD",
    user_actual_id: 1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm,
  },
  () => {
    console.log("track call");
  }
);
```

In the above example, the `track` method tracks the `Order Completed` user event along with information, such as the `revenue`, `currency`, and `anonymousId`.

You can use this method to track various success metrics for your website like user signups, item purchases, article bookmarks, and more.

## Step 4: Check ready state

The JavaScript SDK provides `ready` API with a `callback` parameter that fires when the SDK is done initializing itself and the other third-party native SDK destinations.

An example is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.ready(() => {
  console.log("We are all set!");
});
```
