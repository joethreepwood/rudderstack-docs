  Step-by-step guide on switching from self-hosted data plane to RudderStack-hosted data plane.
---

The steps in this guide assume that you are using the RudderStack-hosted control plane and lists out the detailed steps to switch from self-hosted data plane to the RudderStack-hosted data plane.

## Self-hosted to RudderStack-hosted data plane 

Follow the steps below to switch from self-hosted to RudderStack-hosted data plane:

1. Update the `dataPlaneUrl` in all the SDKs to point to the RudderStack-hosted hosted data plane URL. Refer to the <Link to="/sources/sdks/">SDK documentation</Link> for details on how to obtain the data plane URL.

2. Verify that the self-hosted data plane is no longer getting any requests. One way is to check the load balancer metrics to verify if any requests are still received on your data plane.

3. Ensure that all the events received in the self-hosted data plane are delivered. 

<div class="infoBlock">
It is recommended to keep the self-hosted plane running for a day or two to ensure that all the events are delievered.
</div>

4. Shut down the self-hosted data plane dpending on the way of your deployment. For example, if you have deployed the data plane using helm, run the following command:

```BASH
helm delete <rudderstack-release-name>
```

<div class="infoBlock">
Replace the <code class="inline-code">rudderstack-release-name</code> with the release name of the chart you want to delete.
</div>

## Best practices

* In case of mobile SDKs, your customers need to update their mobile applications. You can keep the self-hosted data plane online until a sufficient number of customers have updated their mobile application or there are no more events coming in to the self-hosted data plane.

Alternatively, you can run an API Gateway or Cloudflare workers to proxy the requests from your self-hosted data plane URL to the RudderStack-hosted data plane URL.

* In case of mobile SDKs, if you are using Firebase to serve the values like `writeKey` and `dataPlaneUrl`, there is no need to update the mobile application to point to the RudderStack-hosted data plane.

* This process of switching the data plane can hamper the order of events as the events are sent both from the RudderStack-hosted and self-hosted data plane at the same time for a while. Hence, it is recommended to choose a low-traffic time slot to carry out this activity.
