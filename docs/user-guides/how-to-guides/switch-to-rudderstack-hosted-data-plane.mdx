  Step-by-step guide on switching from self-hosted data plane to RudderStack-hosted data plane.
---

The steps in this guide assume that you are using the RudderStack-hosted control plane and lists out the detailed steps to switch from self-hosted data plane to the RudderStack-hosted data plane.

## Self-hosted to RudderStack-hosted data plane 

Follow the steps below to switch from self-hosted to RudderStack-hosted data plane:

1. Update the `dataPlaneUrl` in all the SDKs to point to the RudderStack-hosted hosted data plane URL. Refer to the <Link to="/sources/sdks/">SDK documentation</Link> for details on how to obtain the data plane URL.

2. Verify that the self-hosted data plane is not getting any requests.
**{{Steps, if any}}**

3. Verify that all the events received in the self-hosted data plane are delivered. 
**{{`rudder-cli` commands for this}}**

4. Shut down the self-hosted data plane.
**{{Steps, if any}}**


## Best practices

* In case of mobile SDKs, your customers need to update their mobile applications. You can keep the self-hosted data plane online until a sufficient number of customers have updated their mobile application or there are no more events coming in to the self-hosted data plane.

  Alternatively, you can also add an alias DNS record for your self-hosted data plane URL to point to the RudderStack-hosted data plane URL.
**{{Steps to add an alias DNS record, if any}}**

* In case of mobile SDKs, if you are using Firebase to serve the values like `writeKey` and `dataPlaneUrl`, there is no need to update the mobile application to point to the RudderStack-hosted data plane.

* This process of switching the data plane can hamper the order of events as the events are sent both from the RudderStack-hosted and self-hosted data plane at the same time for a while. Hence, it is recommended to choose a low-traffic time slot to carry out this activity.
