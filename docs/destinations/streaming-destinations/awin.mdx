## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending event data to Awin via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Device mode | - | - | - |
| Cloud mode | Supported  | Supported | Supported |

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Awin, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Awin**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Awin as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **Advertiser ID**: Enter your Awin Advertiser ID. For more information on obtaining your advertiser ID, refer to the <Link to="#FAQ">FAQ</Link> section below.

- **Events to Track**: Enter the events for which you want to track conversions. A track call will be made only for the events passed here.

## Track

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call to [send conversion data directly from your server to Awin's servers](https://wiki.awin.com/index.php/Advertiser_Tracking_Guide/Conversion_Pixel_Only_Tracking#Server_To_Server_.28S2S.29).

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
{
  "userId": "identified user id",
  "anonymousId": "anon-id-new",
  "event": "Product Purchased new",
  "properties": {
    "name": "Shirt",
    "revenue": 4.99,
    "voucherCode": "FIRSTSALE",
    "currency": "USD",
    "commissionGroup": "CD"
  },
  "context": {
    "ip": "14.5.67.21",
    "library": {
      "name": "http"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2020-02-02T00:23:09.544Z"
}
```
