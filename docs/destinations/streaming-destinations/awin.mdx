2. Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Awin as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **Advertiser ID**: Enter your Awin Advertiser ID. For more information on obtaining your advertiser ID, refer to the <Link to="#FAQ">FAQ</Link> section below.

- **Client-side Events Filtering**: 

## Track

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call to [send conversion data directly from your server to Awin's servers](https://wiki.awin.com/index.php/Advertiser_Tracking_Guide/Conversion_Pixel_Only_Tracking#Server_To_Server_.28S2S.29).

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
{
  "userId": "identified user id",

    "name": "Shirt",
