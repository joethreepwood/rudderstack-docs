## Identify

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">`identify`</Link> call to create or update a user. RudderStack uses the <code class="inline-code">userId</code> field to perform these actions. 

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify('1hKOmRA4e', {
  email: 'alex@example.com'
});
```

## Track

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call to capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product Reviewed", {
  review_id: "12345",
  product_id: "123",
  rating: 3.0,
  review_body: "Average product, expected much more."
})
```
